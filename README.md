## Overview
Automation of farm activities can transform agricultural domain from being manual and static to intelligent and dynamic leading to higher production with lesser human supervision. This project demonstrates an automated irrigation system which monitors and maintains the desired soil moisture content. A low cost Wi-Fi microchip ESP8266 is used to implement the control unit. The setup uses soil moisture sensors which measure the percentage value of moisture level in soil. This value enables the system to use appropriate quantity of water which avoids over/under irrigation. IoT is used to keep the farmers updated about the status of field. Information from the sensors is regularly updated on Blynk IoT platformâ€™s webpage for the convenience of the farmers.
