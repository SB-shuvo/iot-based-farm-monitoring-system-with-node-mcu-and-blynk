***Please check the report and the presentation slides to get a quick overview***
## Overview
In this project you can get the overall picture of how to implement an IoT based farm monitoring system. We used commonly found farm environment monitoring sensors like DHT11 sensor (for temperature and humidity), soil moisture sensor, sonar sensor etc. We controlled the working of two independent water pump by analyzing the information obtained from the sensors. 
Also, we coupled this system with the Blynk IoT platform. Using the Blynk user interface, we controlled and monitored everything of the system.
